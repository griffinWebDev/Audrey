        <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold">Hi, my name is Audrey Harty. Thank you for taking an interest in my website, and I hope you’re enjoying it.
           Some fun facts about me are that my favorite season is winter, my favorite activity is skiing, I’m a Gemini, I am studying French and I don’t like tomatoes.</P>
            
           <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold">I was raised in the mountains of Park City Utah, but my parents are originally from Minnesota and Iowa. They moved here for the skiing and put me on a pair of skis shortly after I could stand up. We would ski every weekend and I always wanted one of the warm fresh chocolate chip cookies when we went in the ski lodge for lunch.
          
              <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold">My family values food as an experience, rather than just a necessity and that’s how I started to develop my sense of taste. Always observing flavors and textures as I ate, instead of just swallowing so I could have the next bite.</p>
            <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold">My Dad became a pastry chef at Deer Valley resort and when I was 14, I got a job there too. My job started as chopping up fruit and placing it in bowls for the dessert fondue at one of the restaurants, not very exciting but it was a foot in the door.</p>
            <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold"> I’m an artist at heart and my dream was to do the wedding cakes made at the resort in the summer. 
            
              Five years past and at 19 I went to culinary school at Cascade culinary institute in Bend, Oregon for the baking and pastry degree. I was there for a whole year each class lasting three months, with several classes each quarter. <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold">My favorite classes were artisan bread, cake decorating, and culinary math. I quickly realized school wasn’t for me and instead of staying 6 more months for the associates, I left with the one year certificate. I returned home, missing the comfort of the mountains, and continued my education on the job. </P>
            <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold">That summer I finally got to be part of the wedding cake team and loved it. The following seasons I acquired more responsibility and trained new bakers until finally in 2018 I decided to jump ship and leave the Deer valley bakery in search of new experiences.<P class="text-justify font-weight-bold">I got a job as the pastry chef at the Goldener Hirsch Inn, a high end lunch and dinner restaurant attached to the hotel with the same name. It was my first time really running the show and designing plated desserts. I knew I didn’t know what I was getting myself into and it was a maybe over ambitious move, but I felt the need to push myself way out of my comfort zone that I had been in for so long. Personally and professionally I grew immensely that winter.</P>  
            <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold">My dessert menu included their classic Apple Cranberry Strudel with my own spin on it, a Chocolate Mousse Cake with a French Mousse, a Pear Frangipane Tart with pears poached in a sweet gewurztraminer wine, chocolate fondue platter served with fruit, poundcake and house made marshmallows, a cookie platter with chocolate chip cookies, double chocolate chip cookies and toffee pecan cookies, and a quiver of house made ice creams and sorbets, my favorite being the popcorn and browned butter ice cream. We also made home-made pretzels and brioche pull apart bread daily.</P> 
            <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold"> Next I'm off to the big island of Hawaii to travel and work for the summer.</p>
              <P class="text-justify font-weight-bold">My dream is to one day work in a patisserie in France by the Pyrenees Mountains or the Alps.
            </P>
